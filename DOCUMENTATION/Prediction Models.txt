Prediction Models 

=============================================================================================================================================

Objective:

	The goal of the AI phase in Themis is to introduce intelligent prediction capabilities into the existing HR system. These models will 	support fair, data-driven decision-making across critical human-centered domains, such as performance forecasting, attrition risk, and 	promotion readiness.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shift in Strategy :

	In earlier project phases, attempts were made to predefine input/output schemas before implementing the underlying model logic. This	 	approach led to unnecessary trial-and-error cycles and friction in aligning real data with fixed interfaces. For the AI phase, we adopt 	a reversed and more flexible strategy:

Implement the model first, define the schema later based on real outcomes.

This change reflects an evolved understanding of how deep learning workflows behave in practice.


Lessons from the Past - Stanford Dogs Project :

	A pivotal insight came from the Stanford Dogs classification project, where model performance was limited not by architecture, but by 	dataset size and diversity. Despite using deep models, overfitting occurred rapidly due to the fine-grained nature of the task and the 	small number of samples per class. A key realization was that transfer learning worked well because the model began training from a 	well-optimized pretrained state, which helped it converge to a suboptimal yet acceptable point in the loss surface. This validated the 	importance of data richness and proper initialization over raw model complexity.

Models 

==============================================================================================================================================

Performance Prediction :

	Objective --> Predict employee performance for the upcoming period of time
	
	Inputs : 
		- attendance_rate  âœ…
		- num_penalties  âœ…
		- num_raise_requests  âœ…
		- appraisal_amount âœ…
		- num_sick_notes âœ…
		- benefits  âœ…
		- months_at_company âœ…
		- completion_rate  âœ…
		- past-performance_score âœ…
		- sentiment_score âœ…

	Output : 





---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attrition Risk :

	Objective --> Predict the risk of an employee leaving the company

	Inputs : 	
		- age âœ…
		- gender âœ…
		- marital_status âœ…
		- months_at_company âœ…

	Output : 
		Target [0-3] - 4 class problem



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benefit-to-Cost Ratio :

	Objective -->  Estimate how much benefit a company gains from an employee relative to the cost of employing them.

	Inputs :
		- Base_Salary  âœ…
		- num_appraisals âœ…
		- num_benefits âœ…
		- num_raise_requests âœ…
		- completion_rateâœ…
		- past_performance_scoreâœ…
		- skillsâœ…
		- cost_of_trainingâœ…
	
	Output : 
		Target --> Range float between 0-1


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sentiment Score  :

	Objective --> A measure that will be used to try and measure the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction of an employee
	
	Inputs :

	DB obtainable : 

		- Base_Salary  âœ… (ex 8000.00)
		- num_raise_requests âœ…(ex . 7)
		- num_appraisals âœ… (ex . 3)
		- num_benefits âœ… (ex . 4 )
		- num_penalties  (ex . 5)
		- past_performance_scoreâœ… ([0,1,2,3])
		- num_skillsâœ… (ex. 6)
		- cost_of_trainingâœ… (ex . 1300)
		- has training  âœ… (ex, yes or no)
		- attrition_risk âœ… ([0,1,2,3])
		- Age âœ… (ex. (45) )
		- Marital Status âœ… (Married , single . Divorced)
		- attednance_rate âœ…
		- num_sick notes (ex. 4 )âœ…




		- hours_present_per_day
		- workstation_time
		- meetings attended
		- Wandering time
		- Break time
		- stress level (dont include this its  in another table)
		- total_num_of_interactions(dont include this its  in another table)
		- num_conflicts_involved

		- collaboration_score (calculated)

		- comments (dont include this its  in another table)
		- recorded speech / positive(ex. positive text)
		- recorded speech negative (ex. negative text)

		- interactions example (ex text) (calculated)

		- meeting ideas (ex, ideas)
		- movement type (just classify some movement types)
		- sitting posture (classify sitting postures)
		- negative_body_language_signal_score (give a 0 to 1 score float)
		- positive_body_language_signal_score (give a 0 to 1 score float)


	Output :

		Sentiment_score --> [0,1,2,3,4] - SoftMax output




ðŸ§  What This Adds to the Model:
Category	Features You Can Derive
Social Behavior	Conversation frequency, tone, conflict
Physical Cues	Stress signals, absences, movement types
Work Engagement	Desk time, meeting participation
Isolation Index	Low interaction time, high roaming time
Mood Patterns	Negative sentiment in speech + motion
