This schemas are responsible for how data is sent to the API and received from it.
It also verifies input and output , more of validation

orm_mode = true , allows pydantic schemes to access fields via attributes instead of dict keys which would be a hassle 


This file is responsible for the raise-requests including :
 1 -  Submitting a raise-requests will output all the data including {payroll link} in which it will be used to 
        update payroll

 2 -  Creating a new raise-requests will jsut inherit everything from its parent class and 
        create a new request hence the optional columns
        
 3 -  Reading requests which will just return the request list , the id is enough to trigger all information 
        lets not load anything else onto the api we want minimal communication for speed
