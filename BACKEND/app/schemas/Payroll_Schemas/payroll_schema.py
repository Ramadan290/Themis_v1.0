This schemas are responsible for how data is sent to the API and received from it.
It also verifies input and output , more of validation

orm_mode = true , allows pydantic schemes to access fields via attributes instead of dict keys which would be a hassle 


This file is responsible for the payroll including :

 1 -  Base Class will display user and his salary , no info needed for me to explain here i am not that dumb

 2 -  Creating a new Payroll just inherits eveyrhting as we are adding a new record
        
 3 -  Payroll Read , only the id is enough as i said before we dont want a lot fo api communication for speed 

 4 - Payroll Out , is a an approach i may take not sure but maybe to tie the user to his payroll directly i 
    feel its better to link them instead of calling both each time u know always think about performance even if we are not going to achieve it lmao anyways
